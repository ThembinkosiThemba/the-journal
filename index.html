                Hello. This is my first entry on this journal and yeah I know it feels a little wierd. But I've been thinking about starting journaling for a while now and allas, here i am. And, yes I follow this page on twitter that posted a cartoon picture of this person writing. At the start he had a red face (<i>Symbolising anger duh</i>) and as he continued writing, he became less red and eventually he was back to his normal complexion. I am not angry now but i am a bit lonely and i hope when i'm done writing this, I will feel a bit better. I don't think i will get to the details today as this is my first time but don't worry, I will eventually spill all the beans in due time so im leaving you now and i will see you tomorrow. Hopefully.

                Hello again. Still me, alive and healthy writing my second entry. Straight to the point, I saw this developer on LinkedIn today and I was like "I want to reach that level".. not that i wanted him life or whatever. What I fear the most is I feel like I'm not putting enough work. They say doing two hours a day is better that doing 10 hours once in a while cause consistancy is key. I know my work will pay off one day and I hope I get more energy and focus to put in more and more work daily because consistancy. I want that future, I am gonna get it. Now enough about being serious, today I took a dive in the river. Yes I know it's winter and very cold but let me tell you this.. as much as the water was very cold, it felt good after and tomorrow i am going back. So enough for today, I wil see you tomorrow.

                So my day ended pretty well today: did my training as always, took that dive in the cold river, made some progress on my web dev learning and i think i will get help on my genesis trx account. Tho I wish I had some time to study a bit but i couldn't. I will handle that tomorrow. I don't have much to say today so.. adios, see you next entry.

                Greetings. So today I kind of feel bad because I did not do anything. I eventually turned it into a rest day and I must say it should not happen ever again. Basically I went to those default settings I have been aiming to change. NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FALL OFF THE WARGON, I WILL ALWAYS GET BACK ON IT!.
